			Hello QUEER.ARCHIVE.WORK #3 contributors! I&rsquo;m so happy that you agreed to participate. Here are more details, as promised&mdash;

			Theme</span>
<br>
<br>			
			QUEER.ARCHIVE.WORK is itself so specific in its agenda (<em>a collaborative publishing space that features voices who work against the grain; artists and writers interrupting normative narratives</em>), so I tend to stay away from themes. But if you need it, I can share with you what&rsquo;s on my mind these days in the form of this word: URGENTCRAFT. I recently <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gLnHQq2VjPrsRRB_wA-DTmHsRBreET09e-ZpT-j-ez0/edit?usp=sharing" target="_build">wrote/spoke about it</a> so please feel free to dip in and read, but I also encourage you to skip it entirely and simply respond in your own way, without the burden of my specific frame. The primary reason I&rsquo;ve asked you to contribute is because I already see your work through this lens and feel confident that once all of your contributions come in contact with each other there will be a rich conversation, with unexpected connections, alignments, frictions : )

			Contribution</span>
<br>	
<br>
			Please feel free to contribute something new, a work-in-progress, or an existing piece. If it&rsquo;s already been published, perhaps you can experiment with a new format. Your contribution can be as minimal or as maximal as you wish, although there are some constraints in terms of what I can print. 
<br>
<br>
			Please consider these different sizes / methods of printing that I can do. You can design your pages yourself (and deliver to me as a print-ready PDF), give the material to me to design, or we can collaborate! I&rsquo;m open to any of these options. 
<br>
<br>
<br>			<span style="background-color: pink">

			Full-color broadsheet</span>
<UL style="margin-left:100px;">		
			<li>These are large sheets that are folded twice, like a typical newspaper. I get them digitally printed with a print-on-demand newsprint service and the quality is excellent. Super saturated colors on bright white paper.</li> 
			<li>Sheet size: 700mm  x 500mm (27.54 in x 19.68 in) each side front and back

			<li>The broadsheet format is great for large images, a large amount of text&mdash;anything where you want big real estate : )</li>

			<li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/yixgsw400m9cpwh/combo1_1500.png?dl=0" target="_build">Example from #1</a>&mdash;what you see here are 4 different sheets, each open to a 2-page spread. Note that in this issue there were several contributions folded together in this format, so the only way the reader sees the complete sheet front and back is to actually pull it out; otherwise, they only see one page at a time, next to another contributor&rsquo;s page, which makes for interesting juxtapositions.

</UL>
<br>			<span style="background-color: pink">

			Risograph printing</span>
<UL style="margin-left:100px;">		
			<li>I have my own risograph printer and can print your contribution on standard sheet sizes up to 11 x 17 tabloid (including letter and legal sizes). Lots of possibilities here in terms of formatting, from stand-alone prints to multi-page zines.</li>
			<li>Examples from #1 <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/kp844fcl3niov4f/combo7_1500.png?dl=0" target="_build">here</a> and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/4ggazasxrp926cw/combo8_1500.png?dl=0" target="_build">here</a> and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/j6phb2bwig0q1bn/combo11_1500.png?dl=0" target="_build">here</a> and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/mt9kewpclrkadjd/combo14_1500.png?dl=0" target="_build">here</a>. Lots of folding options.</li>
			<li>The risograph only prints one color at a time. The inks I have are <b>black, <font color=maroon>burgundy</font>, <font color=teal>teal</font>, <font color=magenta>fluorescent pink</font>,</b> and <b><font color=rebeccapurple>purple</font></b>. Using more than one color is possible but a lot more work, so let’s talk about that.
</UL>
<br>			<span style="background-color: pink">

			Binding</span>
<UL style="margin-left:100px;">		
			<li>Nothing will be stapled, glued, or taped&mdash;the entire issue will be a loose assemblage, consisting of different contributions printed and folded together, with an envelope or some other type of enclosure, TBD.

</UL>
<br>			<span style="background-color: #FF3300">

			Compensation</span>
<br>
<br>
			All contributors will receive $300 and at least one copy of the publication. I wish it could be more! The fee is a gesture of appreciation and not an accurate representation of how I value your labor. I hope this is acceptable for you but if it&rsquo;s a problem, please let me know. 
<br>
<br>
			<span style="background-color: #FF3300">
			Edition</span>
<br>
<br>
			I will print an edition somewhere around 150&ndash;300 copies. I sell the publication in-person at art book fairs and usually a few copies at Printed Matter. Each copy is $20. For #1 I printed an edition of 300 and it sold out. All of the money went towards paper, printing, risograph supplies, and contributors&rsquo; fees (I do not make any profit). #2 was distributed for free because that issue was totally funded by the Internet Archive. 
<br>
<br>
			<span style="background-color: #FF3300">
			Audience</span>
<br>
<br>
			My publications usually end up in the hands of people who have engaged with me directly at art book fairs and already have an interest in independent, queer, and/or artistic publishing. They are also collected at institutions like MoMA Library, Yale, Joan Flasch at SAIC, MICA, RISD, ICP, Harvard, Whitney, Getty, NY Public Library, and many others. 
<br>
<br>
			<span style="background-color: #FF3300">
			Schedule</span>
<br>
<br>
			I&rsquo;d like to have all contributions in hand by July 31, but earlier would be greatly appreciated, if possible! I will be designing and printing the issue in August, and getting it ready for distribution at the <a href="https://printedmatterartbookfairs.org/" target="_build">NY Art Book Fair at MoMA PS1</a> Sept 19&ndash;22. It&rsquo;s a tight schedule, so any advance notice of what you&rsquo;re thinking will be helpful.
