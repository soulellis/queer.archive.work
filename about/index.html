<br>
<br>
Queer.Archive.Work (QAW) is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) reading room, publishing studio, and project space serving Providence, RI and beyond.

<br>
<br>

 QAW was incorporated in the State of Rhode Island <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/snxa870zd1azoiu/Articles%20of%20Incorporation.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">on March 2, 2020</a> to support artists and writers with free, open access to space and resources for experimental publishing, with a special focus on queer practices. QAW includes <a href="http://queer.archive.work/library">a non-circulating library</a> of books, zines, and objects, <a href="https://queer.archive.work/riso">a risograph printer</a>, and project installation space. Programming includes <a href="../residency/index.html">Risograph Residencies,</a> Open House Free Printing, and Reading Room Workshops. QAW strives to be accountable, to center marginalized voices through intersectional work, and  to cultivate anti-racist, safe platforms for independent, queer publishing. </p> 

<p>
 <span style= "color: #FF8c00; background-color: black">In solidarity</span>

 <br>
 <br>

 QAW stands in solidarity with <a href="https://blacklivesmatter.com/" target="_blank">Black Lives Matter</a> and the movement towards justice for all Black people. QAW supports defunding and abolishing the police, the military, ICE, and prisons, and doing the difficult work required to dismantle white supremacy at all scales, from individual to organizational, from community to national. For QAW, this means a particularly close examination of <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/7jxvxi903efb6qd/White%20Fragility.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">whiteness</a> and how it continues to operate within art, design, and educational institutions and organizations, especially as one of the core intersecting forces of oppression defined as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_of_domination" target="_blank">matrix of domination</a>. 

</p>

<p>
 <span style= "color: #FF8c00; background-color: black">Anti-racism</span>

 <br>
 <br>

 QAW prioritizes anti-racism in our mission and in all that we do. As an organization founded by a white cis man, with two non-black POC board members, QAW benefits from a wide set of intersecting privileges. We are a new organization, and acknowledge that we have challenging work ahead to de-center whiteness in our space, and we prioritize that work. Our mission fails without it. We strive to hold ourselves accountable for this work in all of our programming and decision-making as an organization, especially as it supports QTBIPOC artists and publishers who may benefit from our space.

 <span style= "color: #FF8c00; background-color: black">Our commitments</span>

<br>
<br>

  <span class="li">To maintain programming and resources that are always free to use;</span>
  <span class="li">To maintain a <a href="https://github.com/soulellis/queer.archive.work/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">safe space</a> for experimental publishing, free from unnecessary judgement and expectations, and to make it available for all anti-racists, particularly artists, writers, organizers, students, activists, and educators, and especially for those who are QTBIPOC;</span>
  <span class="li">To support the work of QTBIPOC artists, writers, and small presses by acquiring their work for our growing library of experimental publishing, and to maintain free access to the collection for reference, research, and inspiration for all QAW visitors;</span>
  <span class="li">To maintain our risograph printer and supplies and make them available for free printing for anti-racist art, organizing, and activism (when not in use by QAW artists-in-residence);</span>
  <span class="li">To assemble majority BIPOC review teams when determining access to artist&rsquo;s residencies and other QAW programming, and to always include local, community-based artist representation on these teams;</span>
  <span class="li">To acknowledge and keep visible the specific advantages benefitting QAW as a settler institution occupying the traditional homelands of the Narragansett and Wampanoag peoples, and that this acknowledgement only functions as a first step towards greater decolonial efforts;</span>
  <span class="li">To acknowledge and keep visible the specific advantages benefitting QAW as a tenant within a real estate development that actively contributes to gentrification on the west side of Providence, RI;</span>
  <span class="li">To acknowledge and keep visible the privileges benefitting QAW as an organization founded and directed by a white, queer, cis male artist, with two non-black POC directors, and our combined majority-white institutional affiliations;</span>
  <span class="li">To put these advantages and privileges to work for the benefit of QTBIPOC artists and publishers;</span>
  <span class="li">To learn how to better support our community of QTBIPOC artists and publishers, especially those outside of our own institutional networks and affiliations, and to prioritize access for those who are most underserved and impacted by the matrix of domination.</span>
