We&rsquo;re excited to announce the launch of QAW Risograph Residencies this summer! Applications are being accepted through May 22, 2020.</p>

<p>&#65290;
  <br>
  Queer.Archive.Work has been closed to the public since early March, but we&rsquo;re keeping busy <a href="https://soulellis.com/work/urgencyreader2" target="_blank">publishing</a> and planning and getting our studio ready for new safety protocols. We&rsquo;re confident that if we limit occupancy to only one or two people at a time, we&rsquo;ll be able to carefully welcome people back to QAW this summer. Of course much depends on COVID-19&rsquo;s continued impact on Rhode Island, but if conditions don&rsquo;t worsen, we&rsquo;re planning to begin with the first three residents in August, September, and October.</p> 

<p>&#65290;
  <br>
  QAW residents get access to our <a href="../about/index.html" target="_blank">studio space, risograph printer, and other resources</a> for the realization of a particular project. In selecting residents, we prioritize queer practices, radical publishing, and experimentation, as well as folks who are traditionally underserved (LGBTQIA+, BIPOC, disabled, immigrant, non-RISD/non-Brown University-affiliated).</p> 

<p>&#65290;
  <br>
Each residency may be up to two weeks long, with full access to the studio, the risograph printer, the library, and all equipment and supplies (inks, papers, paper trimmer, etc.), including an unrestricted stipend of $500 awarded directly to the artist, to be used for any purpose that enables them to access the residency (travel, food, rent, project supplies, etc.). This is a work-only residency (no lodging provided).</p>

<p>&#65290;
  <br>
Please note that QAW has one main level that is easily accessed via wheelchair from the street and parking lot, plus two interior spaces that are accessible only by stair. The printer and library are permanently located on the first floor and accessible. Any tools, supplies, and resources that are not already on the first floor may be re-located there for the duration of your residency, if so desired.</p>   

<p>&#65290;
  <br>
  <em><span style="background-color: black; color: #ff3300">To apply</span> for a QAW Risograph Residency, <a href="mailto:queer.archive.work@gmail.com?subject=Riso Residency" target="_blank">send us an email</a> describing your practice, why you would like to access this particular space and its resources, a link to your website, what this opportunity would enable, and what kind of timing would work for you. Accepting applications through May 22, 2020. Applications will be reviewed by artist <a href="http://www.edwigecharlot.com/" target="_blank">Edwige Charlot</a>, writer <a href="https://noranahidkhan.com/" target="_blank">Nora Khan</a>, QAW founder <a href="https://soulellis.com" target="_blank">Paul Soulellis</a>, and QAW director David Kim. The review team will notify applicants about August&ndash;October residencies by mid-June.</em></p>
