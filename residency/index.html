<br>

A Risograph Residency provides access to Queer.Archive.Work&rsquo;s <a href="../about/index.html">studio space, risograph printer, and other resources</a> for the realization of a particular project. Queer practices, radical publishing, and experimentation are prioritized, as well as folks who are traditionally underserved (LGBTQIA+, POC, indigenous, differently abled, immigrant, non-RISD/non-Brown University-affiliated). 
<br>
<br>
Each residency may be up to two weeks long, with full access to the studio, the risograph printer, the library, and all equipment and supplies (inks, papers, paper trimmer, etc.), including an unrestricted stipend of $500 awarded directly to the artist, to be used for any purpose that enables them to access the residency (travel, food, rent, project supplies, etc.). This is a work-only residency (no lodging provided). 
<br>
<br>
Please note that QAW has one main level that is easily accessed via wheelchair from the street and parking lot, plus two interior spaces that are accessible only by stair. The printer and library are permanently located on the first floor and accessible. Any tools, supplies, and resources that are not already on the first floor may be re-located there for the duration of your residency, if so desired.   
<br>
<br>
<em>To apply for a QAW Risograph Residency, <a href="mailto:queer.archive.work@gmail.com?subject=Riso Residency" target="_blank">send us an email</a> describing your practice, why you would like to access this particular space and its resources, what this opportunity would enable, and what kind of timing would work for you. Accepting on a rolling basis for residencies through December 2020.</em>
