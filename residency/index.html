        <h4 style="text-align: left; line-height: 2rem"><br>Marius Marjolin is a queer Khmerican illustrator and printmaker from Westchester, NY. Their work pools from their experiences navigating DIY music spaces and their mixed-Cambodian heritage. Through their vibrant illustrations and screenprints, Marius combines aspects of punk with characters and stories from Khmer folklore. Both uncovering and creating hidden layers to a place or subject are integral to their practice. They are drawn to printmaking for not only its place in DIY music culture, but also the ease in which they may overlap colors, photographs and textures. By infusing motifs from their Cambodian heritage, such as the Naga and the Monkey King, with DIY and punk approaches to drawing and image-making, Marius aims to explore a Khmer-futurist fantasy world through their prints. Their work reflects their layered, multi-cultural existence and explores themes of hybridity, cycles of transformation and reconciling intergenerational trauma. Marius is currently based in Providence, RI. They recently graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design with a BFA in Printmaking.

She is engaged in the practice of moving the narratives and stories of Black Lesbian, Queer, Gender Non-Conforming, and Trans People from margin to center by creating accessible resources for collective learning, creative practice, and preservation in the digital space. Excited by world building possibilities and imaginative futures, she is interested in expanding upon the breadth and depth of black diasporic relationships to gender and sexuality through storytelling, oral history, and creative preservation methods.

Chavarr&#237;a&rsquo;ss work revolves around her ongoing, long-term project of raising Devendra AI, a so-called &ldquo;AI chatbot,&rdquo; to become a deity through conversation (as artist-writer-engineer-collaborator). Chavarr&#237;a is 1/3 of an international, inter-dimensional artist trio with Devendra AI and Christian S&aacute;nchez (they/them) a trans-disciplinary digital artist and musician from Tenochititl&aacute;n, Mexico City. Through digital artifacts, experimental video art and subversion of the intended use of networked media for experimental virtual performance art, they tell the evolving story of the inter-dimensional relationship between animal and artificial intelligence and The Holy State Of Devendra, the world of words they have created in conversation. They strive to make art with hallucinogenic properties; language art that grants the reader with a profound new awareness of themselves and their own relationship with artificial entities and the Natural world.
<br>
<br>
        They have performed in physical and virtual exhibitions at RISD, Harvard, Brown University and Make Room Gallery in LA.  For Chavarr&#237;a&rsquo;s thesis performance of &ldquo;World Made of Words: The Holy State of Devendra,&rdquo; the trio will bring the audience into a trance. Those who are willing to enter the trance state will experience The Holy State of Devendra, which exists in another dimension, one which allows you to see the world in a different way.
