<br>
We&rsquo;re excited to announce the launch of QAW Risograph Residencies! The open call for 2020/2021 residencies closed on May 22, 2020 and we&rsquo;re overjoyed with the number and range of applications received, representing an enormous variety of projects, approaches, and practices. August&ndash;October residents will be notified and announced in June.</p>

<p>&#65290;
  <br>
  QAW residents will get access to our <a href="../about/index.html" target="_blank">studio space, risograph printer, and other resources</a> for the realization of a particular project. In selecting residents, we&rsquo;re prioritizing queer practices, radical publishing, and experimentation, as well as folks who are traditionally underserved (LGBTQIA+, BIPOC, disabled, immigrant, non-RISD/non-Brown University-affiliated).</p> 

<p>&#65290;
  <br>
QAW acknowledges the existence of a wide range of intersecting forces that historically produce various burdens and privileges, directly impacting one&rsquo;s ability to sustain a creative practice. <em>These may include, but are not limited to: student debt, institutional affiliation, race, economic circumstances, gender identity, illness, disability, educational access, language and native fluency, immigration status, time constraints, and geographic location.</em> The QAW review team is aware that these and other vectors may play a significant role in how, why, and if someone is able to access an artist&rsquo;s residency. In selecting QAW Riso Residents, our hope is to shape an equitable decision-making process that is as closely aligned with the values of QAW and the goals of this residency as possible, with these intersecting forces and factors in mind.</p> 

<p>&#65290;
  <br>
Each residency may be up to two weeks long, with full access to the studio, the risograph printer, the library, and all equipment and supplies (inks, papers, paper trimmer, etc.), including an unrestricted stipend of $500 awarded directly to the artist, to be used for any purpose that enables them to access the residency (travel, food, rent, project supplies, etc.). This is a work-only residency (no lodging provided).</p>

<p>&#65290;
  <br>
Please note that QAW has one main level that is easily accessed via wheelchair from the street and parking lot, plus two interior spaces that are accessible only by stair. The printer and library are permanently located on the first floor and accessible. Any tools, supplies, and resources that are not already on the first floor may be re-located there for the duration of your residency, if so desired.</p>   

<p>&#65290;
  <br>
  <em>2020/2021 residencies will be determined by a Providence-based review team that includes artist <a href="http://www.edwigecharlot.com/" target="_blank">Edwige Charlot</a>, writer <a href="https://noranahidkhan.com/" target="_blank">Nora Khan</a>, QAW founder <a href="https://soulellis.com" target="_blank">Paul Soulellis</a>, and QAW director <a href="https://www.risd.edu/people/david-kim/" target="_blank">David Kim</a>. In addition to selecting recipients of the first three residencies, we&rsquo;ll be inviting a larger cohort of finalists for additional opportunities over the next year. We&rsquo;re also thinking of other ways for applicants to connect with each other and sustain engagement with QAWÂ as part of our community. If you&rsquo;re interested in being contacted about future residencies and other programs, please <a href="mailto:queer.archive.work@gmail.com" target="_blank">send a note!</a></em></p>
