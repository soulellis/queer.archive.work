# QUEER.ARCHIVE.WORK (2018)

QUEER.ARCHIVE.WORK is an urgent act of publishing that's radical, messy, and uncertain. It’s a signal sent out into muddy waters, the start of a speculative practice emerging from (and moving towards) the undercommons—a collective place for subversive artists and writers who reject normative narratives. THIS PUBLICATION IS A LOOSE ASSEMBLING OF QUEER METHODOLOGIES, WITH A PARTICULAR VIEW TOWARDS NETWORK CULTURE, FAILURE, AND REFUTATION. It’s an attempt to move far beyond the [_printed web_](https://printedweb.org "Printed Web"). IT’S AN EXPERIMENT IN PUBLISHING AS PRACTICE AS RESISTANCE. Edited by [Paul Soulellis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Soulellis "Paul Soulellis") in Pawtucket, RI.
