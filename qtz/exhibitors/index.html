    </h1>
    <p class="exhibitor-city">Providence, RI</p>
    <p class="exhibitor-bio">Eli Kauffman is a fine artist from Salt Lake City, Utah. They received a BFA in Painting from Rhode Island School of Design, and completed a Maharam Fellowship with Wasatch Community Gardens in Salt Lake City. Eli primarily works with figurative painting and printmaking, as well as textiles and drawing.<br><br>Kauffman works from a combination of photos and film stills to create artificial, diegetic scenes that ultimately exist in a realm of low fantasy. The storylines are semi-autobiographical, revealing resemblance to the lives of the artist and their friends. Through an ever growing collection of reference images, they amplify the disparity between high-brow and low-brow imagery, resulting in art that references both coming of age TV shows, and dialogue surrounding contemporary figure painting. Sensational color and light are primary formal elements to support the storytelling, and reveal the melodrama in familiar experiences.<br></p>

Call us book fairies. We are a playground where joy is big and pleasure is major. Safe spaces aren’t always accessible, but we do our best to be the big spoon. We reemerge secret stories with gentle wonder and welcome close examination. The result is always honest, sometimes playful allegory, and other times irreverent fables.

They draw & write comics, craft weird critters, and enjoy explorations of kitschy playful interdisciplinary art-making. They grew up in the woods of NY, where they first discovered their love for observing and drawing animals, developing a huge soft spot for insects, amphibians, and anyone else that might be hiding under a log. As they grew into an adult and embraced their own queerness, their art developed alongside, evolving to embody themes of identity through both autobiographical and educational content. They love to amalgamate their many interests and experiences, often resulting in colorful drawings and comics of gay animal people. If you hang out enough times they might draw you a fursona.<br></p>

    <p class="exhibitor-bio">Motyko is the name my mami gave me ; a term of endearment. <br>It is the form I take to experience myself. Motyko speaks through historical and cultural iconography, bold colors and textures, the language and energy of social movements, and all of my favorite home cooked meals. <br><br>Growing up I was told to pick and choose between being a lawyer and a doctor. My mami didn’t know that all her spending on crayons and notebooks meant doodling and in true crayon to paper fashion, imagining a world more just and better than our current one. I never picked up a stethoscope but I did listen to the stories of Miguel and Tina, and organized to imagine a world where they weren’t struggling; where they were free. I didn’t become a lawyer (yet!😳) but I organize and strategize to help build a world free of cages and design pieces that translate complex narratives of identity and belonging into digital form.<br><br>With these tools at my side and in the palms of my hands, I create and capture imagery that translates my multicultural and multipurpose existence into our shared realm. </p>

She’s an herbalist, multimedia artist, event planner, and business owner who cultivates various forms of healing and joy for herself and others as often as she can. She’s currently a 3rd-year Ph.D. student who just graduated with her Masters's in Sociology from Brown University and was awarded honors for her Master’s thesis titled “Trauma is Carried in the Spirit: The Praxis, Pedagogy, and Freedom Dreams of Black Women’s Healing Faith Practices.” She’s also so much more than these titles and accolades—she’s Christina’s daughter, a Douglas, Morris, and a Johnson—which means she’s stubborn, brilliant, and skilled at making a way outta no way. When she’s not cooking, spending time in nature, or writing, she enjoys hosting community events on spiritual care, self-love, and various healing modalities or sharing her homemade products with her communities. She first committed herself to a spiritual journey to heal from PTSD and alcoholism—she continues so she can navigate the anxiety and shadows of these 20-somethings in the 2020s. At her core, she prays that her business, her website, her research, her art—everything that comes out of her really—helps her community and herself heal, find joy, and freedom dream beyond our wounds/traumas. </p>
