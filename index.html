Queer.Archive.Work is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit reading room, publishing studio, and project space serving Providence, RI and beyond. 
<br>
<br>
QAW was founded in 2020 to support artists and writers with free, open access to space and resources for  experimental publishing, with a special  focus on queer practices. QAW includes  a non-circulating library of books, zines, and objects, a risograph printer, and project installation space. QAW strives  to be accountable, to center marginalized voices through intersectional work, and  to cultivate inclusive, safe platforms for independent, queer publishing. 
<br>
<br>
All visitors are welcome! This is a safe community space, open and free for all (please see our <a href="https://github.com/soulellis/queer.archive.work/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">code of conduct</a>). Come by to chat about your work, use the risograph printer, or spend time in the reading room. QAW is on the west side of Providence at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/LpdnABGhySME8PPz8" target="_blank">40 Sprague Street #1G, Providence, RI 02907.</a> <a href="mailto:queer.archive.work@gmail.com" target="_blank">Email Paul Soulellis</a> if you&rsquo;d like to visit.

	From <a href="https://cmagazine.com/issues/141" target="_blank"><em>c-magazine 141</em></a> (spring 2019):
	<br>
	<br>
<em>&ldquo;The labour of queer archiving is one of reconstitution, creating, sourcing and grappling with a history marked by silence and erasure. Pulling together a constellation of thinkers and artists, QAW draws from and extends this work, creating a laterally historic meta-image of both &lsquo;queer&rsquo; and &lsquo;archive,&rsquo; by both performing and rethinking these strategies.
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Narrative is often applied over or within an archive, and the desire for an individual understanding of a history almost always influences the making of an archive. What gets archived, and what does not, how it is organized, where it is stored, who cares for it, all play to the politics of the formation of an archive. QUEER.ARCHIVE.WORK feels like a conscious document of this fact, a refusal and an unfixing. In a moment of rapid change and urgency, you can feel it too, slipping out of your hands as you hold it. It is an archive because it has a slow intention, of care and of narrative; a collection because it is necessarily personal, unstable; and it is work because it&rsquo;s being done&mdash;by holding it, you&rsquo;re doing it; it&rsquo;s urgently required.
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Wandering can be a way to avoid a prescriptive back-looking while still keeping an eye on shape, form, and design as things fold and unfold. It can help to determine the obscure and robust logics that publishing practices&mdash;loose and unfixed, framed by dispersion, marked by a series of processes, places, actions&mdash;both utilize and create. QUEER.ARCHIVE.WORK offers that: a set of vulnerable tenets, an open collection of movable, wandering evidence.&rdquo;</em>
<br>
<br>
